This repository contains the code for the article 'Data Visualization of the Observable Universe' published on medium.com in 'Cosmic Cartography' publication.

The notebook is saved without any outputs or pictures, otherwise it's too big to be displayed on GitHub. To get the outputs, you will have to run it yourself.

The notebook contains the sections 'Reference Plots', containing the code for plots used in the article as reference, not directly linked with the article's main exercise.

The Python and relevant libraries versions are in the requirements.txt. Please bear in mind, those are not actual requirements - it can potentially run on a range of versions - this is just what I've been running it on.
